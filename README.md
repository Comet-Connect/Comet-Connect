# Comet Connect
## Technical Specifications
### **Name:** Comet Connect
### **Version:** 0.0.1
### Product Overview
Our program is a website that helps groups find schedules that work best for everyone. Finding the time that works best for a large group of people is difficult, especially when everyone has vastly different schedules. Comet Connect streamlines this by having everyone upload their existing schedule, and letting the program figure out times that are best for the group.

### Product Objectives
Comet Connect will help people with coordinating scheduling between multiple people. It is geared towards groups of people who are having difficulty finding times to meet that work best for everyone.

### Product Features
At its core, Comet Connect allows for users to upload and fill out their schedules. Comets can set preferences for specific time slots to indicate some level of flexibility. The program then takes all of the users in the group and generates the best schedule that works for the group, based on availability and preference. Any user can join multiple groups, and Comet Connect will update your schedule to reflect any new activities added by a group.

### VS Existing Solutions
When2Meet is focused on singular event planning and updating availability is a convoluted process. Comet Connect aims to streamline recurring event planning and automatically update availability across all groups when a meeting time is determined.

### Additional Features
- Looking for group features for popular group based UTD classes. For example, for classes like CS 4485, students have to join groups based on different criteria. Our program could allow for people to form groups in the app and advertise open slots, with certain restrictions (experience, schedules, and project preferences). 
- Incorporating UTD SSO
- Mobile friendly

### Product Technologies
- #### Front-end
  - ##### Dart
  - ##### Flutter
    - Flutter is structured for efficiently building a web app from a single codebase. With Flutter being a popular choice for web developers, there exists a lot of reference materials and documentation to help us with any hurdles that show up.

- #### Back-end
  - ##### MongoDB
    - MongoDB enables a fast and secure query interface, allowing for a safe login system to be implemented. With it being one of the more common database applications used with web development, plenty of tools and resources exist to help us along the way.

- #### Version Control
  - ##### GitHub
    - Github is one of the most widely used version control tools and is free to use. Furthermore, Git has built in integrations for VSCode, the IDE most of us will be using, to make source control even easier.

- #### Project Management
  - ##### Jira
    - One of the most popular project management programs used. The management tool offers a simple workflow that allows you to start work on a task, and keep working on it until it's complete. It can be a great tool for managing agile software development
